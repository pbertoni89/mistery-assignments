Which sed options should you use to change the second-to-last instance of variable to rock so it would read: A
constant is a variable that is a rock that isn't variable

var="A constant is a variable that is a variable that isn't variable"
echo "$var" | sed

O s/variable/rock/*

(o} s/\(.*\)variable\ (.*variable\)/\Lrock\2/'
