You have an ArrayList of names that you want to sort alphabetically. Which approach would NOT work?
© names. sort (Comparator. comparing(String: :toString) )

© Collections.sort (names)

CO names. sort (List . DESCENDING)

>) names.stream().sorted((s1, s2) -> s1.compareTo(s2)).collect (Collectors. toList())
