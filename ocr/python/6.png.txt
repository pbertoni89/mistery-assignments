Which of these is NOT a characteristic of namedtuples?

$ No import is needed to use namedtuples because they are available in the standard library
* You can assign a name to each ofthe namedtuple members and refer to them that way, similarly to how you would access keys in a dictionary
* namedtuples are just as memory efficient as regular tuples
* each member of a namedtuple object can be indexed to directly, just like in a regular tuple
