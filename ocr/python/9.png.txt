What is a static method?

CO Static methods are called static because they always return None.

CO Static methods can be bound to either a class or an instance of a class.

CO Static methods can access and modify the state of a class or an instance of a class.

Â© They serve mostly as utility methods or helper methods, since they can't access or modify a class's state.
